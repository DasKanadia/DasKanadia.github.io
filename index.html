                        I am Zachariah, I am a Computer Science student who has seeked refuge from my own professional enviroment after being engulfed by
                        technology and the burdens it can bear. Trekking the trails leading into nature have not been a hobby I've entrenched myself deep in
                        until late years, but it is the one that serves me the most peace. Retreating into the mountains and forests allowed my head a reset.
                        The alias "Mountain Kong" is a tribute and intuendo to my Vietnamese-Chinese heritage, and my birthplace among the Rocky Mountains.

                        "What adventure is there to have, if we do not take risks? To live is to risk it all, and controversially, even in the face of death.
                        After all, perhaps something is bound to occur in the chaos of life, if you're willing to look for it. In a manner, the best way to 
                        live life is not by having something in the end, but to live it thoughout. 'memento mori', this phrase I repeat all the time. It has
                        taken predecense over the motto that I have inked on my skin 'Find a way, or make one'. Perseverance and life are two things that I 
                        enjoy wielding hand-in-hand. After all, I simply exist to spite both God and the devil alike."
