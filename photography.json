    "description": "During a hiking trip in Montana to explore Glacier National Park, Reynolds Creek was not in our original itinerary, nor the destination of our plan B. This backup hiking plan was to go to Florence Falls, which is a thirty plus metre tall waterfall with nice views. We only stopped by this simple creek on the way in. Yet, Reynolds Creek yields as one of my flagship photos in my portfolio. On the return trip, the sun was past its afternoon arc and starting to set. The sun shone at a low angle, reflecting off the water above the capstone and shining through and off the trees. This lighting exposed many shades of green and reddish-brown, gleaming off and through the vegetation and rock. The angle of the sun deposited deep, contrasting shadows throughout the background. If there is anything I learned from this trip, it is that there is no luck: Sometimes, showing up with no expectations and seeing for yourself what you can find is its own reward."
